# Storybook
This is a repo for common components, views and layouts to be reused in multiple projects

Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time.

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context. That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as stories to revisit during development, testing, or QA.
